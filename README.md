This is the Second Version Update of Villicus, and I have expanded its capabilities. 

For this edition, I opted not to use a explict tutorial and instead researched ways to add the new phishing detector feature.

I applied the API to scan links and provide insight into whether or not they were phishing attempts.

ALL of the foundational code was written by me, and I used VS Code's built-in CODEX feature to assist with debugging and organization.

The concept, new features, and application of cybersecurity are all original with respect to coding authenticity.

(Python's suggestion feature also helped a lot [:))

The link to the Streamlit app will be in repository bio.
